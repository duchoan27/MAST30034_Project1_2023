# MAST30034 Project 1 README.md
- Name: Duc Hoan Nguyen

## Student Instructions
You **must** write up `README.md` for this repository to be eligable for readability marks.

1. Students must keep all Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks` directory.
2. Students must keep all `.py` scripts under the `scripts` directory. These can include helper functions and modules with relevant `__init__.py`
3. Students must store all raw data downloaded (using a Python script) in the `data/raw` folder. This will be in the `.gitignore` so **do not upload any raw data files whatsoever**.
4. Students must store all curated / transformed data in the `data/curated` folder. This will be in the `.gitignore` so **do not upload any raw data files whatsoever**. We will be running your code from the `scripts` directory to regenerated these.
5. All plots must be saved in the `plots` directory.
6. Finally, your report `.tex` files must be inside the `report` directory. If you are using overleaf, you can download the `.zip` and extract it into this folder.
7. Add your name and Student ID to the fields above.
8. Add your relevant `requirements.txt` to the root directory. If you are unsure, run `pip3 list --format=freeze > requirements.txt` (or alternative) and copy the output to the repository.
9. You may delete all `.gitkeep` files if you really want to. These were used to ensure empty directories could be pushed to `git`.
10. When you have read this, delete the `Student Instructions` section to clean the readme up.
